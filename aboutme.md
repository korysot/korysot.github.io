## Do you want to more about me? 

We all know that Currillum Vitaes do not reflect the whole picture, but at least they are a quick snapshot: 
[Octopus Woman CV](cv/British_CV__KS___June2022.pdf). If you want a quick overview of my research you could peak 
my university's profile: [Octopus Woman UoE profile]("https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/koraima-sotomayor-enriquez").

## Why this sections is only in _english_!?

Yes, my native language is not english; it is spanish (I'm from Latin America to be precise). 
Yes, all the content of this page is English. No, I do not have an spanish version 
of this website **yet**. No, I did not make this website myself (See [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com) for the original version). 
Yes, I will try to to do it in the future (:
