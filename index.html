<blockquote> "Reflecting on one’s own experiences, emotions, and thoughts creates a reality of internal 
  connectedness and responsibility; reflecting on the other’s perspective, beliefs, and desires creates
  a reality of interpersonal connectedness and recognition; reflecting on how self and others are 
  interwoven creates a reality in which interdependence and mutual influences are acknowledged." </blockquote>
