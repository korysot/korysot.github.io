This website compiles some of the things I have been doing since I started my PhD in Clinical Psychology at the [University of Edinburgh]("https://www.ed.ac.uk/health/subject-areas/clinical-psychology")
under the supervision of [Professor Matthias Schwannauer]("https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/matthias-schwannauer") 
and [Dr Simona Di Folco]("https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/www-ed-ac-uk-profile-simona-di-folco"). 
Currently, I am also a PhD Student at the [IMMERSE]("https://immerse-project.eu")consortium,
and a member of the [Richardson Lab]("https://richardsonlab.ppls.ed.ac.uk").
