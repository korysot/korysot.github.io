## Do you want to more about me? 

We all know that Currillum Vitaes do not reflect the whole picture, but at least they are a quick snapshot: 
[Octopus Woman CV](cv/British_CV__KS___Jun2022.pdf).

If you want a quick overview of my research you could peek 
my university's profile: [Octopus Woman UoE profile](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/koraima-sotomayor-enriquez).

## Why this website is only in _english_!?

My native language is Spanish . 
Yes, all the content of this page is English. No, I do not have an Spanish version 
of this website **yet**. No, I did not make this website myself (See [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com) for the original version). 
Yes, I will try to to implement an spanish version in the future (:
